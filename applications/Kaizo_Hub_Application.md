- **Team Name:** Kaizo Fighters
- **Payment Address:** kaizo-fighters.sputnik-dao.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2 or 3


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

- Kaizo Fighters: A collection of 1750 Robot NFTs on the NEAR blockchain, seeking to innovate and bring notoriety to NEAR.

- With Kaizo, we are seeking to bring innovative utility to the ecosystem which is yet to be seen within NFT projects, and expand the notirarity of NEAR. Being an established top project within the ecosystem, we are currently exploring the ways in which we can assist the NEAR ecosystem expanding in terms of the NFT userbase and community. Our sister company Dojo Finance is a prime example of this. With Kaizo, we feel we have ideas and the platform to shift the focus of NFTs on the chain, and push the ‘meta’ further along its evolutionary timeline, to begin to rival other popular chains like Solana and Etherium in terms of community size and NFT popularity. We feel this only happens through higher quality utility which can bring eyes to the ecosystem from a wider reaching audience, this is what we aim to bring through Kaizo. Alongside our sister company Dojo Finance, as the utility develops, we will be able to expand into one of a kind cross chain nft utility and be one of the first truly cross chain NFT projects.

- After having a very good call with Regina, we discussed the ways in which Kaizo could integrate with Mintbase and bring a lot of benefits to the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem. One example included the upcoming development of our planned staking utility within the ‘Kaizo Hub’ after the launch of kaizo 2.0 (upgrading from pixel art to high quality 3D art, which is a continued element of trying to continually elevate our brand). We see an open source hub for NFT utility as a way of elevating what is possible on NEAR.

- We currently have a staking system with an associated token (unlisted) which is going to be used to upgrade the art from Kaizo 1.0 to Kaizo 2.0 from August 31st. We have several pieces of utility planned alongside the launch of the new art, through a new revised staking system with an associate listed token - Kaizo Coin, within the ‘Kaizo Hub’, which we want to be the a one-stop-shop for all things Kaizo — This will be the heartbeat of the project, with a whole host of utility avenues for Kaizo holders and tools. This next step in our development is another step in continually striving for the utmost quality and continuing to elevate the brand.

### Project Details

Initial mock ups and designs have been created within a pdf lide format to show the flows from page to page of the webpage, which they will most likely be transitioned into figma files during development. But the core mock up is present, which is displayed further within this submission.

- An overview of the technology stack to be used?

    Front end

    - React.js
    - NEAR
    - CSS
    - HTML

    Back end

    - Rust
    - APIs

    Hosting

    - IPFS
    - AWS

- Kaizo Hub Website which houses the following components:
    Kaizo staking (most likely soft staking).
    NFT Training Camp to Upgrade NFT to higher ranks, bringing a gamefi element to the staking system and the community. Unlocking more rewards, such as discounted fees on Dojo Finance Wallet, additional staking multipliers, access to exclusive utility tools, daos etc. This is the flagship section of the Kaizo Hub bringing a gamefi and lore based upgrade system to NFTs with real valued rewards.
    Expansion of Kaizo Collection purchasable with $Kaizo Coin or other currencies through very limited quantities on the store.
    $Kaizo Coin Raffles.
    $Kaizo Coin Auctions.
    Streetwear Apparel + IRL Items such as 3D printed Kaizos purchasable in $Kaizo Coin.
    Integration with cross-chain features through our Dojo Finance Wallet.
    Continually improved utility and tools for Kaizo holders and the NEAR community.
    Full cross chain nft compatibility as a long term goal. Through Dojo Finance.


- Our current staking platform is live and available for use at https://stake-kaizo.netlify.app/ . Where we have 1.32k Kaizo NFTs staked earning $Dojo to upgrade their NFT art into high quality 3D versions for free by exchanging an amount of our unlisted token they have amassed over the weeks - as an added benefit to the loyal holders. The staking has been live since around 4 weeks after our initial launch, and was one of the first staking systems implemented by an NFT project on the NEAR blockchain, and has been widely well received by our community. At the moment, we have the upgrade process in the works where Kaizo NFT holders will be able to exchange their Pixel Kaizo NFT and 36 $Dojo Token to receive the Kaizo 2.0 art. We are also currently developing Dojo Finance Wallet (non-custodial multi-currency crypto extension wallet) which is part of our sister company Dojo Finance, which will bring direct value back to Kaizo NFT holders, and bring shared resources, userbases, liquidity and more to the NEAR ecosystem.

- Currently, within the Kaizo Hub we plan for the benefits to only be accessible to Kaizo NFT holders, but this could expand further out into the ecosystem over time potentially. As a team I would say we are pretty open to ideas and we don't stay fixated on a certain path which may grow further scope as things develop.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- We are one of the established NFT projects on the NEAR blockchain and we have relationships across the whole ecosystem due to months of building out our NFT project and also Dojo Finance. We feel we fit into the ecosystem as we are long on NEAR, and we are building out features and infrastructure which we feel will bring increased adoption to NEAR as a whole. Dojo Finance is one branch of that, and bringing high level utility to an NFT ecosystem which is in its infancy still when compared to other blockchains, is another part of that. This is our aim.

- Our primary target audience is anyone who is interested in the NEAR blockchain, with Kaizo it is primarily NFT users, but this is not limited to NEAR, as with Dojo Finance we seek to bring cross chain interoperbility, so NFT users of any chain are a target. In addition to onboarding as many people as we can into the NEAR ecosystem.

- Our project meets the need for an established NFT project to develop the next steps of utility within the NEAR ecosystems NFT lifecycle, and push to bring increased volume and eyes to the space. We were one of the first NFT projects to have staking on the ecosystem, and we want to be one of the first projects with a whole ecosystem under its brand, which is what the Kaizo Hub seeks to bring. Kaizo is not similar to other projects as it is tied as a sister company to a cross-chain multi-currency crypto extension wallet, where the NFT project will be at the forefront of technology which will be driving for increased user adoption of NEAR and web3 as a whole.

## Development Status :open_book:

- As previously mentioned, Kaizo Fighters is a long way down its development timeline, with our launch being several months ago. On the 31st August, Kaizo NFT holders will be able to exchange their current NFT and 36 $Dojo Token to exchange it for NFT leading 3D art which has been in development for over 4 months now. This upgrade process will be done on our website.


- We have been documenting our progression with utility ideas on our medium page to update holders and the community on the ideas, while we built out the very high quality art upgrade mechanics. This can be found here: https://medium.com/@kaizofighters

- Additionally, we post regular updates to our discord server and regularly get feedback on their opinions on which paths of utility they would like to see most within NEAR and for Kaizo. Kaizo Hub and Dojo Finance are two things which are largely supported by the community. If you wish to take a deeper dive into the interactions with out community and how we have been building the project : discord.gg/bvZ3HrUgsQ 


- Kaizo Hub, and more specifically the NFT staking for Kaizo Fighters and how it would integrate with Mintbase; was discussed on a call with Regina.

- Current mock ups for the Kaizo Hub prior to figma deisng can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KF2YoFEHaTVXLZ3lvEgPJIWbCLi_iDn3/view?usp=sharing 

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4.5 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  5 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 78,000 USD

### Milestone 1 Example — Kaizo Hub Core Mechanics Setup

- **Estimated duration:** 1.5 - 2.5 months
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 40,000 USD

- We will create a sleek and professional front end which can house all the upcoming features of the Kaizo Hub, with a secure backend to ensure user security.

- Complete the NFT training upgrade mechanics where users can move up the ranks from fighter to senpai to sensei to shihan to renshi to kyoshi and finally hanshi, for the cost of $Kaizo Coin. Unlocking different rewards and emissions the higher they go.

- Complete a dynamic staking system which is rarity based, but is also based off the levels and benefits received from the level of fighter they have upgraded to. Users staking will receive $Kaizo Coin in return.

- Complete dynamic minting system of Kaizo NFTs to expand the collection. The prices displayed would be dynamic and change based off current floor prices of listed Kaizo NFTs, in order to not dilute and lower the existing market.

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

- **Estimated Duration:** Developed in tandem with Milestone 1, but with 1.5 months float beyond initial milestone
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 23,000 USD

- Complete our personalised NFT profiles and statistics page based off user usage and progression with different features of the Kaizo Hub, such as the levelling system and staking. Further development on our Gamefi from Milestone 1. With this being open source this is a feature many communities could use to really drive up community engagement across near.

- Integrate $Kaizo Coin to the Kaizo Hub as a currency which can be used on site, and also open scope for partnered tokens from within the NEAR ecosystem.

- Raffles, Auctions and Streetwear release capability will also be built out to the site within this milestone.


### Milestone 3 Example — Dojo Finance Wallet Integration

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD

- This would involve the Integration of random beta access code drops and other rewards to regular users of the Kaizo Hub.
- Giving a benefit to repeat users who are active within the ecosystem access to emerging quality technology early.

- This milestone would also involve NFTs that are staked or training within the Kaizo Hub still showing within the Dojo Financne Wallet and showing their progress overlayed onto the wallets NFT in the wallet while staked.

- Also including continued improvements, tweaks and potential bug fixes to any features from previous milestones.


...
## Future Plans

- We want to continually scale Kaizo alongside Dojo Finance. As Dojo Finance brings cross chain interoperability, shared userbases, technology and liquidity. We see the future of Kaizo being cross-chain integrated within the Dojo Finance Wallet allowing true cross-chain NFT utility which can be sustainable and bring benefits directly back to the chain which each avenue of Kaizo expands into down the line. 
The Kaizo hub will be the foundation for these steps to begin. Dojo Finance public beta is getting closer (1.5-2 months), so the opportunity for cross chain Kaizo utility through Kaizo Hub is also getting closer.

When we discuss cross chain for Kaizo, we mean it in a way which brings users and exposure to NEAR, which is the ecosystem we have grown on and want to do our part in continuing its growth.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 

- Being well integrated within the NEAR ecosystem, the team were already familiar and aware of the great work Mintbase was/is doing. The call with Regina opened our scope into ways in which Mintbase and Kaizo could work together in ways which isn't just simply a grant, we would be very open to interoperability and collaboration on this project between both parties, to bring the best possible product and benefits to the NEAR ecosystem and web3.

- A brief snapshot of work we have already done:
    Kaizo Staking System for $Dojo
    Upgraded NFT art from pixel to 3D
    Upgrade mechanics to allow the art upgrade in exchange for an NFT and 36 $Dojo to occur
    Fostered the growth of an NFT community and tech start up for several months to this point
    Established beneficial relationships with several projects and communities within the NEAR ecosystem
    Fundraised 2 rounds for Dojo Finance reaching $225,000, moving into our next round now.
    Designed and progressed the idea of Dojo Finance from start to its current MVP working state
    Internal public beta release dates for Dojo Finance arranged

- There are additional ideas for scope which we have and would love to discuss over a call with the mintbase team, rather than initially proposing too much to begin with. 

- Previously applied and received grant from the NEAR Foundation. Separately for Dojo Finance, we are applying for the Web3 Foundation Grant.

- Any additional information required or comments, or further details on our sister company Dojo Finance; then we are more than happy to facilitate that information through follow up messages, discussions and calls. We are very keen to work together with mintbase.
